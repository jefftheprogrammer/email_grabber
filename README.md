# email_grabber
the purpose of this project is to grab emails from a list of student IDs. 

This uses the python-ldap package which can only be run on linux. If you are on windows, use a VM or WSL2.0.

To run the program, you will need put the import csv file in the same folder as the program and run id_to_email. E.g

`python ./id_to_email.py <insert filename here>`
  
 Please note, the file name should not have .csv at the end of it.
